Programming Tools: Progressive Web Applications allow users to access webpages and apps at an equally fast pace as traditional webpages. The key takeaways with PWAs are that it allows its user to track its information locally in-case the user is using the app and they lose connectivity or internet connection. This allows PWAs to be more flexible in their overall return to the IT community. 

  This is primarily built with HTML, CSS, Javascript. The Back-End is comprised of MongoDB, Mongoose, and Node.js. 

Description: This App will allow you to add or subtract transaction amounts. After the user performs an action of addition or subtraction, a graph will be displayed that allows the user to see in real time their transactions take place.
